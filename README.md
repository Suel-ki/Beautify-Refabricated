What is Beautify?

- Beautify is a client and serverside deco-mod that adds lots of vanilla-styled ways to spice up your builds with custom models.
- My goal with this mod is to increase the detail in builds without killing the need for imagination and creativity.
- Additionally, most blocks include new features. For example, potted plants (such as 1 tall flowers) can be duplicated using bone meal.

Versions [Fabric]: 1.18.2 | 1.19.2
